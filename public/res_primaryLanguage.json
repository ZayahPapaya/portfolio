      "description": "I'm Zayah Lang and I am a software developer. I've picked up software development to embrace my strong points in my career: Like being able to quickly absorb large quantities of information, and working well in group settings. I'm looking to apply these strengths in an environment where I will be able to leverage my memory and curiosity to handle a variety of projects. While it may not seem immediately applicable, my previous career working at a game store has greatly improved my skill in this field; Being able to pick up a complicated game, learn it within twenty minutes, and be able to demonstrate and teach that game to a group of customers is directly applicable to software development in a team. I was born into a family of software developers, but now it's my turn to dive into the industry.",
